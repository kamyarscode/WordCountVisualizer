# WordCountVisualizer
Find words used in a url/document and create bar graph to show how often it is used.
htmltags.txt was used to get rid of some unnecessary words/phrases found in the backend of the scraping.

I created a sorted list of words from highest to lowest using a dictionary, and then used matplotlib to plot the words based on occurrence. 

Things to add would include making it more user friendly.
